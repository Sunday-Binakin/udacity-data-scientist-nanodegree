# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project

This is a repository for my Data Scientist Nanodegree Projects.

## 1. Data Science Blog Post
In this project, I did the analysis of [Stack Overflow Survey Data 2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). You can find my Medium Blog Post in this [link](https://medium.com/@dzakyputra/the-best-countries-for-developers-to-work-in-ec162887f82f?source=friends_link&sk=bab44fcb676ff5ca50a46a65af263690) for the full report. The jupyter notebook for this project is located in folder `1 - Data Science Blog Post`.

Because the data for this project is quite big and I could not put it in the github repository, you can download the data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV/view). We are going to use the `survey_results_public.csv` file.

## 2. Disaster Response Pipeline Project
In this project, we are going to built a web app to do Machine Learning task, which is classifying a message. You can check the running web app in this [link](http://206.189.80.196:3000/).

In order to run this project, you need the model (pickle file) and since the size is too big for github, you can download the pickle model in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ngLraihD2DlodsrLRuz6wLofkWCGaWc5/view?usp=sharing).
